# Kannadafy-deobfuscator

Kannadafy-deobfuscator is a Python tool designed to help reverse engineer and analyze Python scripts obfuscated using `exec` and non-ASCII character tricks (such as Kannada characters). The tool attempts to safely reveal the original source code by replacing dangerous `exec` calls with `print` and capturing the output.
